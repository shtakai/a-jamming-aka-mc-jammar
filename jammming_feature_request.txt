Now Jamming gives users functions as following with Spotify.

Current Jamming Features:
- Login with Spotify.
- Search songs and display search results.
- Select songs from search result to new playlist.
- Remove songs from candidate songs on new playlist.
- Save to new playlist to Spotify.

To improve usability, these key features are nessesary to next release.

New Key Jammming Features:
This feature accomplishes the following:
- Pressing enter triggers a search
- Include preview samples for each track
- Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
- Add an interactive action while playlist is saving
- Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search
- After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect

How it works and implements are on Issues.
